up 1.0
by:  David L. Cantrell Jr. <david@burdell.org>

OVERVIEW

   up is an alternative to the uptime utility on most operating systems.
   It displays the system uptime, but calculates it out all the way into
   decades if applicable (hehe, yeah).  Example of typical up output:

      up 2 weeks 2 days 9 minutes

   It really does nothing more than display uptime like that.
