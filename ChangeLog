(* up version 1.0 released *)
----------------------------
Wed Jul  3 22:37:26 EDT 2002
- Added support for Solaris.
- Modified up.h to use a more portable ifdef notation.
----------------------------
Tue Jul  2 09:06:49 EDT 2002
- Added support for Darwin (MacOS X).
- Updated man page for correct short switch for displaying the version.
- Linux and IRIX now use the utmpx.c method.
- FreeBSD now uses the bsd.c method.
- Changed the way the system dependent stuff works, so there are no longer
  .c files for each OS.  There are .c file for the various methods (utmp,
  bsd, etc.)
----------------------------

- Wrote irix.c so up now works on IRIX (at least 6.5.x).
- Rewrite linux.c to get the boot time the IRIX way, which is reading
  the utmp file and diffing the boot time and current time.  This is a
  nicer solution than reading /proc/uptime in my opinion.

Work on up-1.0 has begun.  I last worked on up in August of 1999, it's
been a while.  :)

- Rewrote up.c to include up.h, which includes the appropriate
  OS-dependent uptime() function.
- Wrote linux.c (Linux-specific uptime function)
- Write freebsd.c (FreeBSD-specific uptime function)
