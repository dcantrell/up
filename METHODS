Each operating system has a unique way of obtaining the uptime.  They are
somewhat common, so the way up works is by defining these methods,
detecting the operating system in up.h, and including the correct method
source file during compilation.  The methods currently supported:

   bsd.c      The BSD-style method for getting the system (a sysctl).
   utmpx.c    Getting the uptime through the utmp file.

Both methods get the boot time and subtract that from the current time.
If you want to add support for a new style, just read one of the above
files to see the prototype for the uptime() function, then write it.  The
up.h file detects the host and includes the appropriate method, so you
will have to add something in there for your host.
